# React scripts.
<p>
1. Install node and npm. 
2. Create a project and configure package.json. 
3. Set up webpack.config. 
4. Using webpack, build the simplest React code using the functional component of the message. 
5. Issue the html file into which the assembly is connected using webpack-dev-server. 
6. Implement the ability to send a new message with fixed text: add button; process a button click with a function that adds a new message to the message array - for example, with the text “Normal”. The handler function should also do a DOM’s renderer so that the new message is not just added to the array, but also appears on the page of the user.
